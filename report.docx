1. A project report (in Word format) covering

   a) a description of the program,

   b) the challenges that you and your team had  and how did you or the team overcome them,

   c) what you have learned by doing the project,

   d) a discussion of algorithms and techniques used in the program, e.g. how to generate the word list, how to validate a word? how does the program work?

   e) contributions of each team member (peer evaluation), 

   f) any suggestions you may have (optional).

Make sure that you write what have you learned by doing this project and peer evaluation parts individually.

2. A short video clip demonstrating the program in action. (If the video is too big you can post it on a website, e.g. youTube, and submit the link). The video should have audio narration explaining the behavior of your program.

3. All MIPS assembly language modules that are needed to run your program.

4. A user manual on how to run and how to use the program.

Obviously items 2. 3 and 4. are the same for all team members but item 1 must be prepared by each student individually (but some sections of the report, e.g. a) and d), can be shared).
