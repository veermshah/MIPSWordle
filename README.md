#Welcome to Wordle!
The objective of Wordle is to guess a 5-letter-word in 6 or less guesses. After each guess you will know whether each letter is in the target word or not - if the letter is in the target word, you will be told whether it’s in the right position in the target word or not.

##Getting Started
Open MARS program, then click File, Open. Select [wordle_final.asm]. Since this is the main file, you don’t need to open any other files, such as the sound files, as they will automatically be called.

##Running the File
To run the game file, click the Assemble button on the top bar, which has a screwdriver and wrench. Then, click the green Play button next to it. Please be patient, as loading times are sometimes long.

##Playing the Game
To play the game, input a 5-letter-word as a guess. Don’t forget to hit enter! After each guess, the program will give you feedback on the letters you guessed. After 6 tries, if you haven’t guessed the word, the program will tell you the correct word. If you guess the correct word before the end, then the program will congratulate you! 

##Tips & Strategies
Start Basic: Try guessing commonly used words to see which letters are correct
Listen to the Program Output: Keep in mind the position of letters
Process of Elimination: Use the incorrect guesses to eliminate incorrect letters

##Happy Wordle-ing! P.S. Make sure to turn up your sound.
