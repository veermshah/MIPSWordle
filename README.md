# Welcome to Wordle!

The objective of Wordle is to guess a 5-letter-word in 6 or less guesses. After each guess you will know whether each letter is in the target word or not - if the letter is in the target word, you will be told whether it’s in the right position in the target word or not.

## Getting Started

1. Open MARS program.
2. Click File, Open.
3. Select [wordle_final.asm].
   
   Since this is the main file, you don’t need to open any other files, such as the sound files, as they will automatically be called.

## Running the File

To run the game file:

1. Click the Assemble button on the top bar (screwdriver and wrench icon).
2. Click the green Play button next to it.
   
   Please be patient, as loading times are sometimes long.

## Playing the Game

To play the game:

1. Input a 5-letter-word as a guess.
2. Hit enter.
3. After each guess, the program will give you feedback on the letters you guessed.
4. After 6 tries, if you haven’t guessed the word, the program will tell you the correct word.
5. If you guess the correct word before the end, then the program will congratulate you!
